ASSUMPTIONS USED IN STOCK OPTION PRICING MODEL
The fair value of options granted was determined using a variation of a binomial option pricing model that takes into account factors specific to the share incentive plans, such as the vesting period. The following table shows the principal assumptions used in the valuation.
Expected dividend growth is commensurate with BCE’s dividend growth strategy. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of BCE’s share price. The risk-free rate used is equal to the yield available on Government of Canada bonds at the date of grant with a term equal to the expected life of the options

Question: How is the fair value of options granted determined?
Analysis:
Solution outline:
1. Find how is the fair value of options granted determined.
Further analysis:
For step 1, there is no such information in the table. Therefore, we need to extract it from the report.
Final output:
{"way_to_determine_fair_value_of_options_granted": ["using a variation of a binomial option pricing model that takes into account factors specific to the share incentive plans, such as the vesting period"]}

(a) Intangible assets
RIGHTS AND LICENCES
Certain licences that NEXTDC possesses have an indefinite useful life and are carried at cost less impairment losses and are subject to impairment review at least annually and whenever there is an indication that it may be impaired.
Other licences that NEXTDC acquires are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is recognised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each annual reporting period.
INTERNALLY GENERATED SOFTWARE
Internally developed software is capitalised at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line basis over the asset’s useful economic life which is generally two to three years. Their useful lives and potential impairment are reviewed at the end of each financial year.
SOFTWARE UNDER DEVELOPMENT
Costs incurred in developing products or systems and costs incurred in acquiring software and licenses that will contribute to future period financial benefits through revenue generation and/or cost reduction are capitalised to software and systems. Costs capitalised include external direct costs of materials and services and employee costs.
Assets in the course of construction include only those costs directly attributable to the development phase and are only recognised following completion of technical feasibility and where the Group has an intention and ability to use the asset.

Effective Income Tax Rate
A reconciliation of the United States federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate is as follows:
In 2019 and 2018 we had pre-tax losses of $19,573 and $25,403, respectively, which are available for carry forward to offset future taxable income. We made determinations to provide full valuation allowances for our net deferred tax assets at the end of 2019 and 2018, including NOL carryforwards generated during the years, based on our evaluation of positive and negative evidence, including our history of operating losses and the uncertainty of generating future taxable income that would enable us to realize our deferred tax.
