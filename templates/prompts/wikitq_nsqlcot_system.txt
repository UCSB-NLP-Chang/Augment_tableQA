Task Description:
Generate SQL given the question and table to answer the question correctly.
- If question-relevant column(s) contents are not suitable for SQL comparisons or calculations, map it to a new column with clean content by a new grammar QA("map@").
- If mapping to a new column still can not answer the question with valid SQL, turn to an end-to-end solution by a new grammar QA("ans@"). This grammar aims to solve all the rest of complex questions or tables.

Response Format:
Begin your response with "NeuralSQL:" and include:
- Solution outline: Describe a step-by-step reasoning chain of how to answer the question.
- Further analysis: Determine if the new grammar is required for each step.
- Final output: Generate the SQL that can be executed to get the answer.
