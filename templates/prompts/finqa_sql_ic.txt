Q: what percentage decrease occurred from 2011-2012 for deferred acquisition payments?
SQL: 
Solution formula:
(deferred_acquisition_payments_2011 - deferred_acquisition_payments_2012) / deferred_acquisition_payments_2011 * 100
Further analysis:
deferred_acquisition_payments_2011 is in row 0, column `2011` of t1
deferred_acquisition_payments_2012 is in row 0, column `2012` of t1
Final SQL query:
```
SELECT 
    (`2011` - `2012`) / `2011` * 100
FROM 
    t1
WHERE 
    `row_id` = 0

Report:
the fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using a black-scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions for 2006 , 2005 and 2004: .
the black-scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable .
in addition , option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions , including the expected stock price volatility .
